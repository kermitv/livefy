# Livify Brainstorm

## Vision
A personal command center that helps you decide what to do next, not just store tasks.

## User Promise
- Fewer open loops in your head
- Daily focus without over-planning
- Weekly momentum toward bigger goals

## Core Jobs To Be Done
- Capture quickly when life is noisy
- Convert brain-dump into concrete next actions
- Balance urgent tasks with important long-term goals
- Track habits/energy to learn what works

## v1 Scope (build this first)
- Daily dashboard: top tasks, habits, notes, weekly outcomes
- Quick capture inbox
- Mark done/undone states with local persistence
- Lightweight weekly review prompt

## v2 Candidates
- Calendar sync (Google/Apple)
- Smart scheduling suggestions ("best 90-minute window")
- Reflection analytics (what drains energy vs. helps)
- Shared goals (partner/family accountability)

## Opinionated Product Direction
- Prioritize clarity over feature count
- Use "Today + This Week + Later" as primary structure
- Keep friction low: 1-tap capture from mobile home screen
- Add AI only where it removes decision fatigue

## Brainstorm Questions
1. Is this mainly for your personal use, or eventual public release?
2. Do you want this to replace your current tools or sit on top of them?
3. Which pain is worst today: planning, execution, consistency, or overwhelm?
4. Would you trust AI to auto-prioritize tasks if you could review quickly?
5. How important is mobile-first vs desktop-first in the next 30 days?

## Suggested Next Build Steps
1. Add an "Inbox" list separate from top tasks.
2. Add drag-and-drop for task prioritization.
3. Add a weekly review modal with 5 prompts.
4. Add simple charts for completed tasks and habit streaks.
