# Open Loops

Items that require future thought or revisit.

- Best long-term strategy for automating Ollama startup in WSL
- How to surface "things to revisit" prominently in Livefy UI
- When and how to safely introduce OpenClaw
- Ideal data model for decisions and follow-ups
- Whether OpenClaw should run on home hardware or VPS first
- Final runtime/hosting architecture (explicitly deferred until after Phase 1 capture loop is stable)
