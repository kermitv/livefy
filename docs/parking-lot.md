# Parking Lot (To Revisit)

## Yak Shaving Candidates

- Mac optimization for AI mode (apps to uninstall vs disable)
- Long-term decision on where Livefy runs when away from Mac
- Whether to maintain a local LLM long-term vs hybrid cloud
- OpenClaw’s possible role in the future
- Secure remote access to personal assistant from phone
- Cost-minimal deployment options (Vercel, tunnel, etc.)

## Notes

These are valid concerns but intentionally deferred.
Priority is getting Livefy to a minimal usable state first.
