# Capture and Organize: Working Answer

## Q

I do not want to think about "where it runs" right now. That is an open loop for later.

Will Livefy make it easy to capture and organize conversation outputs across:
- projects
- life
- work
- to-dos
- planning and brainstorming notes

## A

Yes. That is the core workflow Livefy is designed for.

The practical rule is:
- capture now
- organize later

Livefy should not force up-front classification for every entry.

## The Core Flow (Phase 1)

### 1. One universal Inbox

Everything goes into one Inbox first:
- thoughts
- tasks
- ideas
- plans
- open questions
- "come back to this later" items

No forced up-front decision about type, project, or domain.

### 2. Lightweight processing when ready

Later, when reviewing on desktop, process inbox items into:
- Decisions
- Open Loops
- Next Actions
- Notes
- Project references

AI can help extract structure, but user review/approval is required.
Nothing auto-disappears.

### 3. Simple buckets, low schema pressure

Use a small set of durable buckets:
- Inbox
- Decisions
- Open Loops
- Next Actions
- Projects
- Reference Notes

Items can optionally have:
- project links
- tags

No rigid hierarchy required.

## Mapping Conversation Types to Buckets

- Task execution details -> Next Actions (+ optional Project)
- Brainstorming/food for thought -> Open Loops or Notes
- Planning -> Decisions + Next Actions
- "Not now" topics -> Open Loops

This turns unresolved thinking into tracked objects instead of mental overhead.

## Design Rules for Ease

- Capture must be faster than thinking (single input, quick save)
- Organization must be optional and deferrable
- System should resurface relevant unresolved items during review

## Scope Reassurance

You do not need to settle final infrastructure now.

"Where it runs" remains an explicit open loop until later phases. Livefy should hold that uncertainty without blocking progress on capture and follow-through.

## Immediate Build Direction

Next foundation steps:
- define Inbox entry format
- implement simple capture UI
- add minimal project-link/tag support
- keep architecture and automation decisions deferred
