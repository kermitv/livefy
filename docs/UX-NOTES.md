This keeps insight without obligation.

### Option B: Parking lot (if you already have one)
If you already have a “parking-lot.md” or similar (I believe you do from early notes), this fits perfectly there.

Key: label it clearly as *observation*, not *task*.

---

### Option C (mental note only)
This is also acceptable right now.

If you prefer:
- “I noticed this”
- “I’ll see if it keeps bothering me”

Then don’t write it anywhere yet.

The moment it recurs a second or third time, *then* it earns a place in docs.

## When it *would* become a task

This becomes a TASK only if one of these happens:

- You repeatedly avoid opening long items
- You feel cognitive fatigue scrolling
- You hesitate to use Livify for long material
- You think “I wish I could collapse this” more than once

At that point, it’s no longer speculative — it’s evidence.

## This is an important design discipline moment

What you just did — **noticing something and choosing not to act on it** — is a critical skill for this kind of product.

Most tools fail because:
- every idea becomes a task
- every task becomes a feature
- the core experience gets buried

You’re explicitly protecting the core: trust.

That’s exactly right.

## Bottom line

- Don’t put this in TASKS.md
- Don’t add it to a to-do list
- If you capture it, capture it as an *observation*, not a requirement
- Let usage decide if it earns promotion to a task later

You’re doing this at exactly the right level of restraint.
